    Generate the best move.

    Input parameters:
    - board: np.array of the current board.
    - player (BoardPiece): Represents the player for whom the move is generated.
    - saved_state (SavedState): Represents the state of the game that might affect move generation.

    Steps:
    - Columns for each of the possible moves are considered.
    - Each of these moves is evaluated by the minimax.
    - Column index with the best move is returned.

    Returns:
    - Tuple[PlayerAction, SavedState, int]: Best move, game state, and number of evaluated moves are returned.
